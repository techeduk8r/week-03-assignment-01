I am Briana Allen, a tech geek, educator, crafter and maker, sewist, outdoor adventurer, and lover of all things feline.

From an early age I was a teacher. I was that kid who loved to play school over the summer. I looked forward to those last days of school when we got to take home all of the workbook pages that hadn't been completed. I would "teach" the kids at my babysitter's house throughout the summer.

When I was 8 or 9 my uncle brought home an Apple Macintosh for my cousins to use. From the moment I first explored the drawing program I was hooked. My cousins and I started a newspaper, Bear Tracks, that we produced weekly and gave to our parents. We drew comics, wrote stories and interviewed people. We spent the next several years exploring computers and BBS, making friends across the area.

These two passions megred when I began exploring how technology could be used to teach and help students learn. Beyond games, I was interested in students being able to create content. This led to my purssiut of an Ed Tech degree and profesisonal roles as an instructional coach, teaching other educators how to use technology to engage students in real-world and creative learning experiences.

Beyond my role as an educator, I devote a lot of my time to volunteering at PAWS Chicago as a mentor, volunteer lead, foster, and feline behavioral trainer. When not volunteering, I love to sew, bake, and spend time outside hiking, biking, camping and exploring.
